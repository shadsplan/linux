# Chapter 6. Processes

## 6.1 Processes and Programs
- A process is an instance of an executing program.
- A program is a file containing a range of information that describes how to construct a process at run time. This information includes the following:
    - Binary format identification: Each program file includes metainformation describing the format of the executable file. This enables the kernel to interpret the remaining information in the file. One widely used formats for UNIX executables were the original a.out ("assembler output") format, but nowadays, most employ the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF).
    - Machine-language instructions: These encode the algorithm of the program.
    - Program entry-point address: This identifies the location of the instruction at
which execution of the program should commence.
    - Data: The program file contains values used to initialize variables and also literal constants used by the program (e.g., strings).
    - Symbol and relocation tables: These describe the locations and names of functions and variables within the program. These tables are used for a variety of purposes, including debugging and run-time symbol resolution (dynamic linking).
    - Shared-library and dynamic-linking information: The program file includes fields listing the shared libraries that the program needs to use at run time and the pathname of the dynamic linker that should be used to load these libraries.
    - Other information: The program file contains various other information that describes how to construct a process.

| We can recast the definition of a process given at the start of this section as follows: a process is an abstract entity, defined by the kernel, to which system resources are allocated in order to execute a program.

From the kernel’s point of view, a process consists of user-space memory containing program code and variables used by that code, and a range of kernel data structures that maintain information about the state of the process. The information recorded in the kernel data structures includes various identifier numbers (IDs) associated with the process, virtual memory tables, the table of open file descriptors, information relating to signal delivery and handling, process resource usages and limits, the current working directory, and a host of other information.

## 6.2 Process ID and Parent Process ID
- Each process has a process ID (PID), a positive integer that uniquely identifies the process on the system. Process IDs are used and returned by a variety of system calls.
- Each process has a parent—the process that created it. In effect, the parent process ID attribute of each process represents the tree-like relationship of all processes on the system. The parent of each process has its own parent, and so on, going all the way back to process 1, init, the ancestor of all processes.
- If a child process becomes orphaned because its “birth” parent terminates, then the child is adopted by the init process, and subsequent calls to getppid() in the child return 1.

## 6.3 Memory Layout of a Process
- The memory allocated to each process is composed of a number of parts, usually
referred to as segments:
    - The text segment contains the machine-language instructions of the program run by the process. The text segment is made read-only so that a process doesn’t accidentally modify its own instructions via a bad pointer value. Since many processes may be running the same program, the text segment is made sharable so that a single copy of the program code can be mapped into the virtual address space of all of the processes.
    - The initialized data segment contains global and static variables that are explicitly initialized. The values of these variables are read from the executable file when the program is loaded into memory.
    - The uninitialized data segment contains global and static variables that are not explicitly initialized. Before starting the program, the system initializes all memory in this segment to 0. The main reason for placing global and static variables that are initialized into a separate segment from those that are uninitialized is that, when a program is stored on disk, it is not necessary to allocate space for the uninitialized data. Instead, the executable merely needs to record the location and size required for the uninitialized data segment, and this space is allocated by the program loader at run time.
    - The stack is a dynamically growing and shrinking segment containing stack frames. One stack frame is allocated for each currently called function. A frame stores the function’s local variables (so-called automatic variables), arguments, and return value.
    - The heap is an area from which memory (for variables) can be dynamically allocated at run time. The top end of the heap is called the program break.

## 6.4 Virtual Memory Management
A virtual memory scheme splits the memory used by each program into small, fixed-size units called pages. Correspondingly, RAM is divided into a series of page frames of the same size. At any one time, only some of the pages of a program need to be resident in physical memory page frames; these pages form the so-called resident set. Copies of the unused pages of a program are maintained in the swap area—a reserved area of disk space used to supplement the computer’s RAM—and loaded into physical memory only as required. When a process references a page that is not currently resident in physical memory, a page fault occurs, at which point the kernel suspends execution of the process while the page is loaded from disk into memory.

In order to support this organization, the kernel maintains a page table for each process (Figure 6-2). The page table describes the location of each page in the process’s virtual address space (the set of all virtual memory pages available to the process). Each entry in the page table either indicates the location of a virtual page in RAM or indicates that it currently resides on disk.

Virtual memory management separates the virtual address space of a process from the physical address space of RAM. This provides many advantages:

- Processes are isolated from one another and from the kernel, so that one process can’t read or modify the memory of another process or the kernel. This is accomplished by having the page-table entries for each process point to distinct sets of physical pages in RAM (or in the swap area).
- Where appropriate, two or more processes can share memory. The kernel makes this possible by having page-table entries in different processes refer to the same pages of RAM. Memory sharing occurs in two common circumstances:
    - Multiple processes executing the same program can share a single (readonly) copy of the program code. This type of sharing is performed implicitly when multiple programs execute the same program file (or load the same shared library).
    - Processes can use the shmget() and mmap() system calls to explicitly request sharing of memory regions with other processes. This is done for the purpose of interprocess communication.
- The implementation of memory protection schemes is facilitated; that is, pagetable entries can be marked to indicate that the contents of the corresponding page are readable, writable, executable, or some combination of these protections. Where multiple processes share pages of RAM, it is possible to specify that each process has different protections on the memory; for example, one process might have read-only access to a page, while another has read-write access.
- Programmers, and tools such as the compiler and linker, don’t need to be concerned with the physical layout of the program in RAM.
- Because only a part of a program needs to reside in memory, the program loads and runs faster. Furthermore, the memory footprint (i.e., virtual size) of a process can exceed the capacity of RAM.
- One final advantage of virtual memory management is that since each process uses less RAM, more processes can simultaneously be held in RAM. This typically leads to better CPU utilization, since it increases the likelihood that, at any moment in time, there is at least one process that the CPU can execute.

## 6.9 Summary

- Each process has a unique process ID and maintains a record of its parent’s process ID.
- The virtual memory of a process is logically divided into a number of segments: text, (initialized and uninitialized) data, stack, and heap.
- The stack consists of a series of frames, with a new frame being added as a function is invoked and removed when the function returns. Each frame contains the local variables, function arguments, and call linkage information for a single function invocation.
- The command-line arguments supplied when a program is invoked are made available via the argc and argv arguments to main(). By convention, argv[0] contains the name used to invoke the program.
- Each process receives a copy of its parent’s environment list, a set of name-value pairs. The global variable environ and various library functions allow a process to access and modify the variables in its environment list.
