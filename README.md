# linux

## todos

- Networking: dig/ip/ping
- python: file io, argparse, main, (maybe: os stuff, threading)

- some perf videos
- vmstat/iostat/ - eh, maybe later.

## really nice tidbits:

- `grep -E "HEADER_PATTERN|SEARCH_PATTERN"` is a great way to find what you're looking for, and include the header line!!!

## things i wanna know well

- threads vs processes
- fork vs exec
- inodes
- setuid, setgid
- tmux
